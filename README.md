# homelab

This repository is the "production-ready" version of my homelab environment.

## Structure

- [`docker`](docker/README.md) (Docker Compose files and supporting documentation)
- [`external-landing`](external-landing/README.md) (The external landing page for non-VPN users)

Additional documentation is present in each module's directory.
