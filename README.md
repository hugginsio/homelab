# 🏚️ Homelab

All my homelab related configuration and notes in one place.

- `docker`: Docker Compose stacks from each standalone node
- `external-landing`: external webpage with VPN setup instructions
- `kubernetes`: Kubernetes clusters managed with FluxCD
- `talos`: cluster configurations for *the Kubernetes operating system*

## 🎯 Goals

- Use clusters instead of multiple machines with distinct roles to increase resiliency.
- Use automation where possible to reduce setup and maintenance toil.
- Explore parts of infrastructure management that are taken care of by other teams at work.
