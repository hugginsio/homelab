# 🏠 Homelab

Homelab adjacent automation, configuration, and notes.

- `docker`: Docker Compose stacks from each standalone node
- `external-landing`: external webpage with VPN setup instructions
- `kubernetes`: Kubernetes clusters managed with FluxCD
- `talos`: cluster configurations for *the Kubernetes operating system*

## 🎯 Goals

- Provide useful applications and services for my family.
- Use clusters instead of multiple machines with distinct roles to increase resiliency.
- Explore parts of infrastructure management that are taken care of by other teams at $JOB.
- Use automation where possible to reduce setup and maintenance toil.
